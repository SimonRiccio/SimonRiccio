# 💫 About Me:
Hi there 👋

I'm a Cybersecurity Master's student with a deep passion for offensive and defensive security. I thrive on the challenge of bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. My goal is to build a career as a Penetration Tester or SOC Analyst, and I'm always looking for the next challenge to solve.

* 🔭 **I’m currently working on:** Completing my Master's degree in Cybersecurity and sharpening my offensive/defensive skills on platforms like Hack The Box and TryHackMe.
* 🌱 **I’m currently learning:** Ethical hacking through CTFs and challenges! It's the best way for me to apply my theoretical knowledge in a hands-on environment.
* 👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on:** CTF teams, open-source security tools, or any project involving vulnerability research or blue team tactics.
* 🤝 **I’m looking for help with:** Mentorship from industry professionals and opportunities to get real-world experience in Pentesting or Security Operations (SOC).
* 💬 **Ask me about:** My favorite CTF write-ups, vulnerability analysis, or the latest security trends.
* ⚡ **Fun fact:** My idea of a fun Friday night often involves a new CTF and a root flag to capture.
